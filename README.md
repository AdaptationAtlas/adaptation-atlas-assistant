# Adaptation Atlas Assistant

[![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/AdaptationAtlas/adaptation-atlas-assistant/ci.yaml?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/AdaptationAtlas/adaptation-atlas-assistant/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)

We're building a standalone app that will generate visualizations and text summaries of Atlas data from a user's natural language prompt.
These visualizations and summaries will be modeled after the stories already in-use on the [Adaptation Atlas](https://adaptationatlas.cgiar.org/).

We track our work on the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/AdaptationAtlas/projects/6).
