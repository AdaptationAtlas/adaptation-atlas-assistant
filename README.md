# Adaptation Atlas Co-pilot

We're going to develop a standalone app that will generate visualizations and text summaries from a user's natural language prompt.
These visualizations and summaries will be modeled after the stories already in-use on the [Adaptation Atlas](https://adaptationatlas.cgiar.org/).
